## 🔄 Branching Strategy

This project follows the **GitFlow workflow**:

- `main`: The stable, production-ready branch  
- `development`: Active development happens here; all feature branches are merged into this  
- `feature/*`: New features or enhancements should branch off from `development`  
- `bugFix/*`: New features or enhancements should branch off from `development`  
- `hotfix/*`: For urgent fixes based on `main`, if needed

#### 📌 Contribution Flow

1. **Branch off from `development`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. **Open a pull request** **into `development`**, not `main`
