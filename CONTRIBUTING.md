## üîÑ Branching Strategy

This project follows the **GitFlow workflow**:

- `main`: The stable, production-ready branch  
- `development`: Active development happens here; all feature branches are merged into this  
- `feature/*`: New features or enhancements should branch off from `development`  
- `bugFix/*`: New features or enhancements should branch off from `development`  
- `hotfix/*`: For urgent fixes based on `main`, if needed

#### üìå Contribution Flow

1. **Branch off from `development`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. **Open a pull request** **into `development`**, not `main`

## üßë‚Äçüíª Naming Conventions

To maintain consistency in the codebase, please follow these naming conventions:

---

### üêç **snake_case**  
Used for **variables**, **functions**, and **methods**.

```python
# variable
user_name = "Alice"

# function
def get_user_data():
    return {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# method inside a class
class User:
    def get_full_name(self):
        return "Alice Johnson"
```

---

### üèõ **PascalCase**  
Used for **class names**.

```python
class UserProfile:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

---

### üî† **UPPERCASE**  
Used for **constants**.

```python
PI = 3.14159
MAX_USERS = 100
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30
```

## Best Practices
